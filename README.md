## Back Yard Talk
### {Bob}   --  Wow! This looks JUST like that other coin...You know...

### {Petey} -- No Shibe! I found ONE mining in my back yard.

### {Petey} -- These shiny things are totally tasteless. You'd be wasting your time, not to mention your toenails digging ANY of these up from this WORTHLESS hard ground!

## What is Petecoin?
Petecoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from "Dogecoin" (...a great coin worthy of such praise, much kindness, providing many real opportuinity to learn, and a wonderful coin (wow!) from which to derive...), Petecoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt.    

### How much doge can exist?
Same as the predecessors'.

### How many bones (I mean conis) will I find?
A different payout scheme was envisioned with block rewards being determined by taking the maximum reward as per the block schedule and applying the result of a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator to arrive at a number between 1 and the maximum reward for that block transition.

##Scheme
###The current block reward schedule:
Halving =  500,000 blocks
Blocks
        <  10,000 (1-999)
        <> 20,000 (1-1999)
        <> 30,000 (1-2999)
        <> 40,000 (1-3999)
        <> 50,000 (1-4999)
        <> 60,000 (1-5999)
        <> 70,000 (1-6999)
        <> 80,000 (1-7999)
        <> 90,000 (1-8999)
        else      (9999)
